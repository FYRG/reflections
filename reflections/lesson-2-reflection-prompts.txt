What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
使用git init建立代码库，但是由于没有提交，所以还是初始提交的状态，可用git log查看提交日志，发现其实是零提交。然后用git status进行验证，发现有代码库，可能还有工作目录下代码库之外的文件。
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
暂存区属于代码库和工作目录之间的模块，待提交的文件从工作目录提交到代码库需要先提交到暂存区，此时可以批量也可以单独，通过git add filename来添加，如果出现需要删除的不想提交的文件则通过git reset filename进行暂存区的文件删除。
